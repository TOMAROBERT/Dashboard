# Sensors Dashboard

The system is controlled by a sensor that measure the distance to a known object. If the distance to the object is smaller than the established distance then the water pump will enable and it will deliever the liquid needed for hands disinfection.

The distance between the object and the sensor, the water level and the water temperature are monitored and graphically expressed through dynamic web pages. These datas can be visualized in a database through the Firebase platform, in the exact moment of their takeover.

The share of the web pages to network is made using the ngrok app, which by the tunneling session principle allows the access to the web interface from anywhere, using any type of internet connection.
